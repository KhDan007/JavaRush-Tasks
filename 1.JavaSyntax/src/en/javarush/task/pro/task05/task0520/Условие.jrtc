Practice declaring and changing the values of variables while a program is running:
1. Put a break point on the call to the println method and run the program in debug mode.
2. After execution stops, press F8 exactly 9 times.
3. Look at the current value for the correction variable and set the fahrenheit variable to the same value (in the debug window).
4. Press F8 6 more times.
5. Look at the current value of the correction variable and assign this value to the result field (change the source code).

This means there should be only one change in the Solution class: the result field should be initialized when it is declared.


Требования:
1.	Don&#39;t change the main method.
2.	The result field must be assigned the correct value.
