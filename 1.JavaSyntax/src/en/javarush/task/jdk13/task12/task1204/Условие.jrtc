taskKey="en.javarush.task.jdk13.task12.task1204"\n\nNumbers and strings

The add method should add up the input arguments and return a string like this:
a+b=sum
For example, if you pass (7, 8) to the method, then it should return the string &quot;7+8=15&quot;.
But the method is not working properly at present. Your task is to fix it.


Требования:
1.	The add method must return a string as outlined in the task conditions.
