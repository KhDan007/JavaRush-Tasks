&quot;Amigo, did you know that lunar gravity is about 17% of gravity on Earth?&quot;
&quot;Nope.&quot;
&quot;Neither did I. Now this information will be used a lot. To avoid having to manually calculate it each time,
implement a getWeight(int) method that takes a person&#39;s body weight on Earth (in newtons), and returns the weight
of that person on the moon (in newtons). The method should return a double.&quot;

Consider this example:
The getWeight method is called with the argument 888.
Example output:
150.96


Требования:
1.	The getWeight(int) method must be public and static.
2.	The getWeight method must return a double.
3.	The getWeight method should not display anything.
4.	The getWeight method should correctly convert the Earth weight in newtons to the lunar weight, and then return this value.
